Demo code of "SAM-CTMapper: Utilizing segment anything model and scale-aware mixed CNN-Transformer facilitates coastal wetland hyperspectral image classification"

It might take me a few months to get the relevant code organized. 

If you're in urgent need of the code and data, please don't hesitate to reach out to immortal@whu.edu.com, and I'll be happy to provide you with the code in its current state ~ 🫡🫡

## Step 1: prepare dataset
**GF-5 Yancheng & ZY1-02D Huanghekou**: https://zenodo.org/records/8105220

**Prisma Shuangtai & Prisma Chongming**: [百度网盘，提取码 quja](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1VPapO_ZT_QfrfTcWT6mv7Q?pwd=quja) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1macw4UJ2ADywohav9AqSxEG-MwiwupNW?usp=sharing)

## Step 2: train and test
```
python main.py --cuda 0
```

## Step 3: record classification result
